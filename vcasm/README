Assembler for the VideoCore IV processor.
I have tested this with MinGW but it should work on any UN*X compatible system with standard dev tools (gcc, flex, bison).

See here for documentation on the instruction set:
https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv/wiki/VideoCore-IV-Programmers-Manual

This assembler is quite basic - I plan to add support for vector and some other instructions soon, hopefully.
TODO:
- Vector instructions
- Conditional instructions: addne r0, r1
- addcmpbne ...
- bne r0, r1, LABEL
- long jumps/branches
- other instructions as they are figured out.

I hope this assembler will simply be a temporary development tool, and that we can eventually add VideoCore support to binutils, LLVM/gcc, etc.


Releasing under the GPLv2 as it contains some Linux kernel source, as well as some code from Jon Povey's DCPU-16 assembler:
